# Breast Cancer Classification

## Description

- Predicting if the cancer diagnosis is benign or malignant based on several observations/features 
 - 30 features are used, examples:
         - radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
         - texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
         - perimeter
         - area
         - smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
         - compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
         - concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
         - concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
         - symmetry 
         - fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

## Dataset

The experimental study is based on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer database from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. [Dataset Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(original))

The Breast Cancer database was obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg. It contains 699 instances, 458 (65.5%) benign and 241 (34.5%) malignant cases. Each case is characterized by 9 attributes as described by Table I and two classes (benign and malignant).
